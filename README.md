# Software-Testing-Blackbox
Blackbox


Description
For this assignment, you will be writing unit tests based on the following specifications/requirements.

You will write a series of unit tests to test a function called credit_card_validator (written for you) that is passed a sequence
of digits as a string that represents a credit card number. This function will return True if it is a valid credit card number, 
otherwise, it will return False.

Depending on the credit card issuer, the length of a credit card number can range between 10 and 19 digits. The first few digits 
of the number are the issuer prefix. Each credit card issuer has an assigned range of numbers. For example, only Visa credit card 
numbers may begin with 4, while American Express card numbers must begin with either a 34 or 37. Sometimes, credit card providers 
are assigned multiple ranges. For example, MasterCard card numbers must start with the numbers between 51 through 55 or 2221 
through 2720 (both ranges are inclusive). 

The last digit of the number is referred to as the check digit and acts as a checksum. Most credit cards calculate this check 
digit using the Luhn algorithm (see resources below for how this is calculated).

In order to limit the scope of this assignment, we are going to limit the number of credit card issuers to 3: Visa, MasterCard, 
and American Express. Each has its own prefixes and length requirements.

Visa
Prefix(es): 4
Length: 16
MasterCard
Prefix(es): 51 through 55 and 2221 through 2720 
Length: 16
American Express
Prefix(es): 34 and 37
Length: 15
Your task is to create a series of tests that attempt to reveal bugs in the implementation. As this is black box testing, you 
will not have access to the source so you must use what you have learned this week to generate test cases.

You will be submitting your code to Gradescope which will auto grade your tests. In order to get full credit on the assignment, 
you will need to locate all 6 bugs in the code (refer to the rubric for full details). Some are easier than others. Bug 5 is easy 
to miss without using Partition Testing and Bug 6 requires using what you know about common errors to design your tests.

You are free to determine how you generate your test cases. You may do it completely manually, or use an automated tool like the 
TSLgenerator. No matter how you generate your test cases, in your file testing file (tests.py), you need to include a comment for
each test case describing:

What the test case (i.e. credit card number) is meant to verify
How you determined what to use as the test case
Here is an example:

# Verifies if Master Cards with valid lengths and invalid check bits returns False
# Picked using Category Partition Testing
def test11(self):
        self.assertFalse(credit_card_validator("...."))
You also need to ensure you have test cases that do a good job covering the input domain. This means that at the very least, you 
need to have a test case for each of the prefix ranges listed above.

Please submit all your tests, even the ones that do not find bugs. Remember, you are practicing writing a testing suite, which can 
be used to test the code again if changes are made. There may be a situation where a previously passing test fails when someone 
updates credit_card_validator.

Finally, your test suite needs to be free of linting errors using the PEP8 standard; this will be important later when working on 
shared repositories. If you are unfamiliar with linting, please see the resources below. The easiest way to accomplish this is to 
ensure that there are no "squiggly" lines under your code in PyCharm (You will need to change PyCharm's default line length to 79 
to match PEP8). You can also use the PEP8 Online tool below to copy and paste your code to verify it has no errors.

Restrictions
For this assignment, you are prohibited from using Random Testing. Yes, Random Testing is a type of Black Box Testing, but you 
will be working with this approach in a later module (Exploration: Random Testing). You will not receive points for any bugs 
triggered by Random Testing. This means that you cannot use code to generate the test cases, you need to come up with them yourself.
Please restrict yourself to using other Black Box Testing techniques: Error Guessing, Partition Testing, and Boundary Value Testing.
